# Graph-Coloring-Simulation

The chromatic number of the given graph is calculated and the colored graph is shown in this simulation

The program is made using python3 language using Tkinter and Turtle libraries

Sample input and corresponding output images are provided in the repository for a better understanding

Input is the number of nodes in the graph, number of edges and the edges, and the maximum number of colors to be used ( _the rgb colors are chosen randomly by the algorithm itself_ )

Output is a colored graph if the given graph can be colored using less than or equal to the given number of colors else error message will be displayed

_So if "c" number of colors are given and the given graph can be colored using only "x" colors where "x" is less than or equal to "c"_

_( i.e.., x <= c ) then the output shown in the simulation will use only "x" colors for coloring the graph and the value of "x" will also be shown_

### Below are some sample images of the simulation
