# Graph-Coloring-Simulation

The chromatic number of the given graph is verified and the colored graph is shown in this simulation

The program is made using python3 language using Tkinter and Turtle libraries

Sample input and corresponding output images are provided in the repository for a better understanding

Input is the number of nodes in the graph, number of edges and the edges, and number of colors to be used ( _the colors are chosen randomly by the algorithm itself_ )

Output is a colored graph if the given graph can be colored by the given number of colors else error message will be displayed
